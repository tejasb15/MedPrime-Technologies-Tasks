## Assignment 1: Renaming All Files in a Folder Sequentially

**Objective**: Develop a Python program that renames all files in a specified folder by numbering them sequentially, starting from 1, while retaining their original file extensions.

**Details**:

- The program prompts the user to input the path to a folder.
- It lists all files in the specified folder, excluding subdirectories.
- Files are renamed in the format `1.ext`, `2.ext`, `3.ext`, and so on, where `.ext` is the original file extension.
- The program handles errors such as invalid folder paths and permission issues gracefully.

**Files**:

- `Assignment 1/rename_files.py`: The main script implementing the renaming functionality.

## Assignment 2: Zipping a Folder

**Objective**: [Brief description of the objective of Assignment 2.]

**Details**:

- [Key features and functionalities implemented in Assignment 2.]

**Files**:

- `Assignment 2/[filename]`: [Description of the file.]

## Assignment 3: Creating a Collage from 4 Images

**Objective**: [Brief description of the objective of Assignment 3.]

**Details**:

- [Key features and functionalities implemented in Assignment 3.]

**Files**:

- `Assignment 3/[filename]`: [Description of the file.]
